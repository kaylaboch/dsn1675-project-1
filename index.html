<em>Introducing the one, and only, me.</em>
I am a loving and caring especially about animals. My hobbies include horseback riding, football, fishing, and spending my time outside. I grew up in a little area called Dunrobin where everyone knows each other. My high school was right on Dunrobin road where I was with the same group of kids basically since kindergarten until we all split up for post-secondary school. I am not very quiet but I keep to myself at the same time.

<em>About my artâ€¦</em>
I am in second year Graphic Design, and am passionate about art. My art style is a detail and more technical. I draw with pencil and pencil crayons to create life-like characters or animals. I enjoy using computer programs for art and photography.  I have sold some pieces of my art.
